# A website for crowd-sourcing structured election candidate data

YourNextRepresentative is a open source platform for
crowd-sourcing information about candidates for political office
and making it available as open data to anyone.

The core data that YourNextRepresentative collects includes who
is standing, what party theyâ€™re standing for, their contact
details, their social media accounts etc. The software requires
that each change is submitted with a source, so that the
collected information can be independently checked.

This codebase was used for
[YourNextMP](https://edit.yournextmp.com) in the UK for the 2015
General Election, and has also been reused in Argentina, Burkina
Faso, St Paul (Minnesota) and Costa Rica.

The codebase is internationalized; if you want to help to
translate the project into a new language, we use
[Transifex to allow anyone to contribute translations](https://www.transifex.com/mysociety/yournextmp/).

This project is still under active development, so please
[get in touch with us](mailto:ynr@mysociety.org) to let us know
of your plans, and requirements you have and hopefully we can
provide support for your project.

The following other documentation files may be of use to you,
depending on what you're trying to do:

* [A guide to setting up YourNextRepresentative for a new country](docs/new-instance.md)
  This is a work-in-progress, describing what's involved in
  setting up YourNextRepresentative in a new country.
* [Notes on setting up a dev version of YourNextMP with vagrant](docs/vagrant.md)
  This was created to make it easy for developers and designers
  to get started working on YourNextMP (the UK site), and may be
  still be of some use.
