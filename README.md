# A website for crowd-sourcing structured election candidate data

https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/

YourNextRepresentative is a open source platform for
crowd-sourcing information about candidates for political office
and making it available as open data to anyone.

The core data that YourNextRepresentative collects includes who
is standing, what party theyâ€™re standing for, their contact
details, their social media accounts etc. The software requires
that each change is submitted with a source, so that the
collected information can be independently checked.
