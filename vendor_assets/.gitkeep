This empty directory is only present in the repository temporarily (whilst the
app is being containerised) to ensure the directory exists for the
/non/-containerised (i.e. production) environment.

It is created explicitly in container/build/Containerfile, therefore this
directory can be removed when the containerised app has replaced the current
VM-based setup in all environments.

As per the comment in container/build/Containerfile, don't expect this
directory to accumulate or expose CSS or JS assets during local development.
This directory is deliberately *not* bind-mounted into the running container,
which means that any in-container processes (e.g. gulp; collectstatic) that use
it will have an effect inside the container only - their changes won't be
visible outside the container.
