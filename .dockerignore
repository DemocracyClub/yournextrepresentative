# This file contains paths, .gitignore-style, that will be excluded from being

# cf. https://docs.docker.com/build/concepts/context/#dockerignore-files

# Start with a clean slate by excluding all paths.

# Selectively re-include paths to copy into the container. This list should
# track and match the bind mounts for the "frontend" service in the
# docker-compose.yml file.

# Paths overriding early re-inclusions.
# The content inside /ynr/media/ is bind-mounted into the container when
# running as part of a compose stack, as part of the bind-mount of its parent,
# /ynr/. However its contents *should not* be statically copied into the
# container image because they're either irrelevant/empty (in non-development
# environments), or potentially very large (in development environments).
/ynr/media/

# Paths that don't need to be part of the image, but also need not to be
# excluded when explicitly referenced by build-time COPY and ADD commands.
