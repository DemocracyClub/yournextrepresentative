<p>| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |<br>
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|<br>
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |<br>
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |<br>
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |</p>
<p>There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.<br>
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the<br>

<p>Markdown | Less | Pretty<br>
--- | --- | ---<br>
<em>Still</em> | `renders` | <strong>nicely</strong><br>
1 | 2 | 3</p>
