<div class="further-copyright-explanation">

  <h4>Why are we asking you to agree to this?</h4>

  <p>
    When we originally set up {{ site.name }} for the 2015 UK general
    election we didn't get legal advice about the best way to deal
    with copyright and licensing. It turns out that the way that the
    user agreement that was worded on the 'About' page had a few
    problems, and in particular restricted what we could do with the
    data such that we couldn't license the database to some partners
    who we thought would make good use of the data but who needed
    slightly different licensing. The simplest way to ensure that we
    can make the data as widely available as possible while preventing
    the hard work of contributors to {{ site.name }} being co-opted by
    companies building closed candidate databases is to ask you to
    assign the copyright of your contributions to {{ settings.COPYRIGHT_HOLDER }}.
