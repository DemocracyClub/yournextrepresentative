  <p>Democracy Club Candidates is an open source platform for crowdsourcing information about candidates standing for
    political office in the UK.</p>

  <p>The resulting data is open for anyone to use. This website powers Democracy Club's <a
  href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk">WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk</a>, and the data has been used by The Electoral Commission
    and many other sources.</p>

  <p>The core data collected by Democracy Club Candidates includes who is standing, what party theyâ€™re standing for,
    their contact details and social media accounts. The software requires that each change is submitted with a source,
    so that the collected information can be independently checked.</p>


<p>
Please email <a href="mailto:{{ email }}">{{ email }}</a>
with any feedback or bug reports. If you'd like to discuss this
site or any other project relating to elections in the UK, we'd
suggest that you <a href="https://slack.democracyclub.org.uk/">join our Slack</a>.

<h3>Moderation and complaints</h3>

<p>
We operate a proactive moderation policy as regards images, and a reactive policy as regards text. 
All images uploaded to the site are checked by a staff member or trusted volunteer before being published.
Text published by users is regularly reviewed. Text about candidates contributed to this site is also published on WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk,
where we maintain feedback forms to allow readers to report issues to us.
</p>
<p>
We will respond to any and all complaints made about the service, unless obviously malicious. This includes complaint subjects as referred to by the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/section/72/enacted#section-72-8">Online Safety Act 2023</a>:
</p>

</p>
<p>
Any text which we judge to be malicious or illegal in the UK will be removed as soon as it is brought to our attention, and the offending accounts will be banned from making further contributions. 
In particular, we would draw your attention to the list of offences provided in Schedules <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/50/schedule/5">5</a>,

<h3>User accounts</h3>
<p>
User accounts created on this website do not require anything more than basic email verification. 
It is not possible to use these accounts for any purpose other than to edit election candidates; there is no functionality for communicating directly with other users. 
There is also no functionality for embellishing user profiles (for example, you cannot upload a photo of yourself, or add biographical information). 
Consequently, we believe the danger presented to individual users is extremely low. 
</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>
  We do not require age verification to create an account. 
  Based on past experience, we do not believe that this site offers any unique danger to child users, but we take this matter extremely seriously.
  Any attempt by users to ascertain age or biographical information about other users will likely result in an account ban. 
</p>
<p>
As people below the age of 18 are ineligible to stand in UK elections, any attempt by a child to post information about themselves will be removed as soon as it is brought to our attention.
However, the data produced by this site is intended for the use of all UK voters, including those aged 16 and 17; please bear this in mind when making edits.
