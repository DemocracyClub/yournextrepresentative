    <h3>Suggest locking</h3>

    <p>
      If you think the candidates for this ballot is complete,
      please suggest that we lock it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please only do this with good reason, for example if you have reviewed
      the official lists of candidates ("Nomination papers" or
      "Statement of Persons Nominated") linked to above.
    </p>

    <p>
      Locking a list means that candidates can't be added or removed, but
      their details can still be edited. This is useful when we know that
      the list is final.
