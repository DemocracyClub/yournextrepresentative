and any reuse is shared under the same licence.
[Please read the full terms for more information](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

This licence excludes:

* The party logos, which are taken from the Electoral Commission's website
* Candidate photos, which are typically either submitted by the candidates themselves,
  or from sources where it seems reasonable that we might use them on this site,
  such as the party's official page for that candidate, or their social media profile picture.

If the CC-BY-SA licence is problematic for you, but you feel that you have a worthwhile use of
the data in mind, please contact us to discuss your situation further.

#### Giving attribution

If you are reusing our data, please credit "Democracy Club" on the same page(s) as the data is used,
and provide a link (or write the URL in the case of printed material) to
[https://democracyclub.org.uk](https://democracyclub.org.uk)

We would like you to include [our logo](https://static.democracyclub.org.uk/static/dc_theme/images/logo-with-text.png)
alongside the data, but we understand that this won't always be possible.
