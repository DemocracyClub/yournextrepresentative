**A *read only* API for information stored about UK candidates and how they relate to ballots.**

**If you are after postcode lookups for current elections and polling stations,
then you should use [our other API at our developers site](https://developers.democracyclub.org.uk).**

This is our internal "bleeding edge" API version that we use for developing new ideas
and for syncing between sites.

At the moment this is the best API version to use, however **it is subject to change
in the near future**, so you should [get in touch](https://democracyclub.org.uk/contact/)
about your requiremnts and to hear about breaking changes.

We plan on publishing a `v1` API once we have some more feedback from users
and we think it's stable enough.



### High level concepts

*Candidates* are a mix of a *person* and a *candidacy*. A *candidacy*
is the *person* on a *ballot*. *Ballots* have *elections* and *divisions*
(areas, currently called *posts*).

A *person* can stand in more than one election, that is, they can have many
*candidacies* on different ballots.

*Ballots* make up the main structure of the data, with each ballot being
grouped by *elections* or *divisions*.

Apart from the base data model, there are two other concepts in this API.

Firstly, the data will change over time, from a ballot being announced through to results being entered.


## Timeline of a ballot

Ballots are created soon after they are added to Every Election. This is typically a few months
before the polls open. In the case of by-elections they are added as soon as we hear about them

Scheduled elections are more complex, as we know a long time in advance when a given council
will have an election, but we don't know if a boundary change will happen in that council area
until quite close to the election. We add scheduled elections as soon as we think nothing will
changes about them, however we still maintain the ability to cancel and replace ballots.

As soon as a ballot is created it's possible to create *candidacies* for them. And candidacy
added to the ballot before the *SOPN* is published is speculative and typically sourced from
candidates or parties asserting that they intend to stand in that election.

After a {{ "OfficialDocument"|link_to_definition:"next,SOPN" }} is published it is uploaded
and archived on the site. This starts a process of *locking*. *Candidacies* are locked once
two people have checked them against the *SOPN*.

Once the election has taken place, results can be added. Results data is added to the ballot
and candidacy objects.


### People

A `Person` object contains information about a person that doesn't change inline with ballots.
That is, although a person's name might change over time, they typically don't change *per candidacy*.

For more on the fields on a `Person` object, see the
{{ "Person"|link_to_definition:"next,reference documentation" }}.

### Candidacies

A `Person` can have none or more `candidacies`. Candidacies are times that a person has soon for
election, as recorded on this site.

A `Candidacy` object contains basic information about the `Person`, `Party` and `Ballot`, as well
as results after the election.


### Elections

{{ "Election"|link_to_definition:"next,Elections" }} in this project are imported from and share
identifiers with our [Every Election](https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/) project.

{{ "Election"|link_to_definition:"next" }} objects represent an event that elects
{{ "Person"|link_to_definition:"next,People" }} to an
{{ "Organization"|link_to_definition:"next,Organization" }}. All
{{ "Election"|link_to_definition:"next,Elections" }}
have at least one {{ "Ballot"|link_to_definition:"next,Ballot" }} as a child object.



### Data sources and coverage

The election and ballot elements of the data come from our
[Every Election](https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/) project, and the candidate data
is crowdsourced by users of this website.

Party data comes from
[The Electoral Commission](http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Search/Registrations).

The project contains data for all general election candidates since 2010, scheduled election candidates
for local, police and crime commissioners, devolved governments and mayoral elections since 2016.
See the {{ "ElectionType"|link_to_definition:"next,Election Types" }} section for more information about elections covered.
