  <p>
    These CSV files contain details of all candidates in the database including contact details
  parties and elections they have stood in.
  </p>

    <p>
There is a row per candidacy, so if a single person has stood on 3 ballots,
      they will have 3 rows in the "all candidates" file.
  </p>
  <p>
  There is a CSV per election, and per election date. This means for example, "the 2018 local electons"
  have file per local authority (election) and a file for the date they were all held on, combined
  </p>

    <h3>Election results</h3>
