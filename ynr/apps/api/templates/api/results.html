<h2>Types of results</h2>
  <p><strong>At the moment, we only support results for elections that use First Past The Post.</strong></p>

  <p>We store two different types of results: <strong>elected</strong> and <strong>votes cast</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>Elected</strong> results involve just setting a flag on the <em>candidacy</em>
  that the person was elected. This is the simplest form of result, and is often the quickest and easiest
  information to collect.</p>

  <p><strong>Votes cast</strong> results are the numbers of votes cast per person. For first past the post
  elections, the winners are set based on the number of winners for that ballot.</p>

<h2 id="winners_csv">2019 General election 'elected' CSV</h2>
<p>For the 2019 General election we are publishing a CSV of winners, overnight.</p>
  <p>The CSV will contain a header row, and then one row per ballot containing information
  about the winner. No <em>votes cast</em> data will be in the CSV</p>

<a href="{% url "parl-2019-csv-results" %}" class="button">Download the CSV</a>

<p>The headings of th CSV are:</p>
  <table class="table api_defs">

        <code>joint-party:53-119</code> 'Speaker seeking re-election'. All other values should match

<h2 id="atom">ATOM feeds</h2>
<p>There is an atom feed of recent election results available in two versions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="{% url 'atom-results' %}">Atom feed with additional machine-readable elements</a></li>
  <li><a href="{% url 'atom-results-basic' %}">Basic Atom feed</a></li>

the feed with additional extra elements with a single

<p>

  If you're using this feed, please be aware that it's possible
  that a volunteer will record the wrong winner in error. In
  that case, there will be an entry in the feed to indicate that
  that statement about the winner has been retracted. If you're
  using the extended feed, that will have
  a <tt>&lt;retraction&gt;1&lt;/retraction&gt;</tt> element. If
  you're using the basic feed, then the entry will look like:
</p>

<pre class="feed-example">
&lt;entry&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Correction: retracting the statement that Tessa Jowell (Labour Party) won in Dulwich and West Norwood&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;summary type="html"&gt;At 2017-06-09 11:25:00, a example.com volunteer retracted the previous assertion that Tessa Jowell (Labour Party) won the ballot in Dulwich and West Norwood, quoting the source 'Result recorded in error, retracting'.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  This feed contains results from any election, so if you just
  want to get results for the 2017 General Election, say, you
  should filter
  for <tt>&lt;election_slug&gt;parl.2017-06-08&lt;/election_slug&gt;</tt>.
