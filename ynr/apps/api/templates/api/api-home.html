### Formats

We have data in [CSV format]({% url "api_docs_csv" %}) or a REST API.

There are currently two API versions, [v0.9]({% url "api-root" version="v0.9" %})
and [next]({% url "api_docs_next_home" %}).

`v0.9` is stable but soon to be deprecated as it doesn't reflect the common needs users have has.

It's best used for bulk downloading all data from this site because it's hard to filter or look up
candidates by a single ballot.

`next` is our "bleeding edge" or "HEAD" API version, so it's unstable but does have a more useful
feature set and interaface. If you want to consume our API, this is a good starting point but it's
a good idea to [contact us](https://democracyclub.org.uk/contact/) before you do.

We plan on creating a `v1` API version soon, that will be close to the current `next` API.
