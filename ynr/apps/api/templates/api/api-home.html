# Candidates API

<img src="{%  static "images/ballot-relations.png" %}">

## High level concepts

This API contains data on candidates standing for elections in the UK, and related data.

### Elections

`Elections` in this project are imported from and share identifiers with our
[Every Election](https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/) project.

`Election` objects represent an event that elects `People` to an `Organisation`. All `Elections`
have at least one `Ballot` as a child object.

#### Fields
##### `Slug`

An `election` slug contains 3 or 4 parts:

* Election type
* Election subtype (optional)
* Organisation
* Date polls open

For example, <a href="{% url "election-detail" version="next" slug="gla.c.2016-05-05" %}">
<code>gla.c.2016-05-05</code></a>.

For more on the ID system, see the
[Election Identifier Reference](https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/reference_definition/).

##### `url`

The URL to the election object

##### `name`

The name for this election

##### `election_date`

The date of the election, in ISO format

##### `current`

Current is a concept that we add to elections. Any election whose date is 3 months in the future or 20 days
in the past is marked as current by defult, however we have the ability to mark elections as current for
different timeframes as we see fit.

##### `organization`

An `organization` object with basic information on the organization that candaites are elected to.

##### `party_lists_in_use`

A boolean indicating if the election uses a list based voding system. If this is True then candidates
on an ballot in this election are expect to have an integer for their `party_list_position`.

##### `ballots`

A list of objects containing a ballot paper ID and a URL to the full ballot object.


### Ballots

A `ballot` has candidates, and election and other meta data. It's the "lowest level" of election ID.
