# There is no concept of a "default" emblem with The Electoral Commission.
# Each emblem has an ID and candidates pick the emblem when they stand.
# However, there are emblems that a more generic than others, so we try to use
# them for the "default" party emblem. For example, The Labour Party might have
# and emblem for "Labour" and "Welsh Labour". In the majority case, showing the
# "Labour" emblem is the best thing to do.
# Normally we're safe to use the emblem with the lowest numerical ID returned by
# the API for the party, however in the following cases the lowest ID emblem
# isn't the best to use. This is an override for the emblem we will call
# deafult.
