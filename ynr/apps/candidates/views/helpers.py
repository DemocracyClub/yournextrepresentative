class ProcessInlineFormsMixin:
    """
    A mixin class for `FormView` that handles inline formsets.


    To use:
    1. add `ProcessInlineFormsMixin` to your FormView class
    2. set `inline_formset_classes` to a dict containing the name of the
       inline formset you want in the template context and the inline formset
       class. You can also override `get_inline_formsets` with a method that
       returns a dict of the same structure.
    3. If your inline formsets require any kwargs when instantiated,
       override the `get_inline_formset_kwargs` method. This method will be
       called with the formset name (the key of the `inline_formset_classes`)
       and should return a dict with the kwargs for the form class.

    How it works:
    1. Each inline formset class in inline_formset_classes is instantiated with
       the kwargs returned by `get_inline_formset_kwargs`. They are bound to
       self.request.POST if the request method is POST.
    2. Each of these classes is added to the request context under the key used
       in`inline_formset_classes`.
    3. On POST to the view, `is_valid` is called on each inline formset, as well
       as the main `form` object.
    4. If all forms are valid, self.form_valid is called, with a dict of each
       form as the first arguement. This is a breaking change from using the
       standard FormView that expects a single Form class.
    5. if not, self.form_invalid is called with a dict of all forms.
