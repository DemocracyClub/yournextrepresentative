<p>
Before you carry on to edit data in {{ site.name }}, we need you to
agree that your contributions to this site (with the exception of
photo uploads) are owned by {{ settings.COPYRIGHT_HOLDER }}. In return, we
agree to make the complete database available under an open licence
such as
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC-BY-SA</a>
or remove copyright restrictions by releasing into the public domain
(<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>).

  <h4>Why are we asking you to agree to this?</h4>

  <p>
    This is the simplest way to ensure that we can make this data as
    widely available as possible while preventing the hard work of
    contributors to {{ site.name }} being unfairly co-opted by
    companies building closed candidate databases. This also allows
    us the flexibility to release the data under different open licences
    in the future.
