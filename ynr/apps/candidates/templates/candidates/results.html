  There is an atom feed of recent election results available in two versions:
{% endblocktrans %}

<ul>
  <li><a href="{% url 'atom-results' %}">{% trans "Atom feed with additional machine-readable elements" %}</a></li>
  <li><a href="{% url 'atom-results-basic' %}">{% trans "Basic Atom feed" %}</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example of the former - this is the contents of
the feed with additional extra elements with a single
result:</p>

<pre class="feed-example">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?&gt;
&lt;feed xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom" xml:lang="en-gb"&gt;

<p>The corresponding basic Atom feed would look like:</p>

<pre class="feed-example">

    &lt;/author&gt;
    &lt;id&gt;https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/#32346&lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;summary type="html"&gt;A Democracy Club Candidates volunteer recorded at 2017-06-09 10:36:38 that David Cameron (Conservative and Unionist Party) won the ballot in Witney, quoting the source 'BBC news'.&lt;/summary&gt;
  &lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/feed&gt;
</pre>

<p>

  If you're using this feed, please be aware that it's possible
  that a volunteer will record the wrong winner in error. In
  that case, there will be an entry in the feed to indicate that
  that statement about the winner has been retracted. If you're
  using the extended feed, that will have
  a <tt>&lt;retraction&gt;1&lt;/retraction&gt;</tt> element. If
  you're using the basic feed, then the entry will look like:
</p>

<pre class="feed-example">
&lt;entry&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Correction: retracting the statement that Tessa Jowell (Labour Party) won in Dulwich and West Norwood&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;link href="http://example.com/#32" rel="alternate"/&gt;
  &lt;published&gt;2017-06-09T11:25:00.110335+00:00&lt;/published&gt;
  &lt;updated&gt;2017-06-09T11:25:00.110335+00:00&lt;/updated&gt;
  &lt;author&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;john&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;/author&gt;
  &lt;id&gt;http://example.com/#32&lt;/id&gt;
  &lt;summary type="html"&gt;At 2017-06-09 11:25:00, a example.com volunteer retracted the previous assertion that Tessa Jowell (Labour Party) won the ballot in Dulwich and West Norwood, quoting the source 'Result recorded in error, retracting'.&lt;/summary&gt;
&lt;/entry&gt;
</pre>

<p>
  This feed contains results from any election, so if you just
  want to get results for the 2017 General Election, say, you
  should filter
  for <tt>&lt;election_slug&gt;parl.2017-06-08&lt;/election_slug&gt;</tt>.
</p>

<p>
  The additional XML elements in the extended feed have the following meaning:
</p>

<dl>

  <dt>election_slug</dt>

  <dd>The election ID
    from <a href="https://elections.democracyclub.org.uk/">Every
    Election</a> which is also used in URLs that refer to the election
    on this site.</dd>

  <dt>election_name</dt>

  <dd>The human-readable name of this election</dd>

  <dt>election_date</dt>

  <dd>The date that the election is took place on</dd>

  <dt>post_id</dt>

  <dd>The ID of the post that the candidate has been elected
  to. In the case of the 2017 general election in the UK, for
  example, the post ID of <tt>WMC:E14001046</tt> represents the
  UK parliament constituency of Witney, which
  has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONS_coding_system">GSS
  code</a> E14001046.</dd>

  <dt>post_name</dt>

  <dd>This is the human-readable short name of the post, which
  is typically the name of the constituency or area the
  candidate has been elected to represent, e.g. "Witney".</dd>

  <dt>winner_person_id</dt>

  <dd>The ID of the candidate who was elected to this post,
    which is used to identify them on this website (e.g. in

  <dt>winner_person_name</dt>

  <dd>The name of the candidate who was elected to this post.</dd>

  <dt>winner_party_id</dt>

  <dd>The ID of the party of the winning candidate. This is used
  in URLs on this website, and should be based on an official ID
  for the party. e.g. in the UK, <tt>party:52</tt> is the
  Conservative party,
  which <a href="http://search.electoralcommission.org.uk/English/Registrations/PP52">has
  ID 52 on the Electoral Commission's website</a>.</dd>

  <dt>image_url</dt>

  <dd>If present, a link to a square headshot image of the
  candidate. (You can read about licensing of the photos
  on <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/help/about">the
  About page</a>.)</dd>

  <dt>parlparse_id</dt>

  <dd>If present, this means that the winning candidate has been
  previously elected, and this is their ID that's used on
  TheyWorkForYou, PublicWhip and parlparse.</dd>

  <dt>user_id</dt>

  <dd>The ID of the user of this site who recorded that this
  candidate was elected. This is unlikely to be of any use to
