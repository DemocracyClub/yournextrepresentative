<h3>This API is a work in progress</h3>

<p>
    This is an alpha version of the YourNextRepresentative API,
    which is likely to change in the near future.
</p>

<h3>Browsable API root</h3>

<p>
  The browsable base URL of the site's read-only API is: <a href="{{ base_api_url }}">{{ base_api_url }}</a>
</p>

<p>
  The following sections give examples of how to use the API.
</p>


<h4>... from a postcode</h4>

<p>
Suppose you want to find the constituency for the postcode
SW1A&nbsp;1AA, then you would make a GET request to the
following URL:
</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA</a>
</pre>

<p>
This <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/postcode/SW1A1AA">returns
a JSON object</a>, which contains the details of all the admistrative
areas that cover that postcode. You need to loop over the <tt>areas</tt> object
till you find the area with the correct <tt>type</tt> - for Westminster
constitiencies this is <tt>WMC</tt>. The GSS code for that area is in
<tt>codes.gss</tt>.
</p>

<p>
There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_postcode">postcode
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a> and
<a href="https://mapit.mysociety.org/docs/#api-multiple_areas">
area codes in MapIt API documentation</a>.
</p>

<h4>... from a latitude / longitude or other coordinate</h4>

<p>
You can look up constituencies in MapIt using a variety of
coordinate systems. To give the most common example, you might
have a WGS84 coordinate from a GPS or location API, in which can
you should put the SRID 4326 in your lookup. For example,
latitude 52.205083 and longitude 0.115194 could be looked up with:
</p>

<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/point/4326/0.115194,52.205083?type=WMC</a>
</pre>

(Note that the longitude comes before the latitude, which might
not be what you expect.) The returned object should have a single
key and inside the value the GSS code is in <tt>codes.gss</tt>.

<p>
There's more documentation available
on <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/#api-by_point">point
lookups on the MapIt front-page</a>.
</p>

<h4>... by selecting it from its name</h4>

If you need to produce a list of all constituencies (e.g. for a
select box) and allow the user to pick one, you can get a list
of all Westminster constituencies in the UK from this request:


<pre class="code-sample">
<a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC</a>
</pre>

<p>
The <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/areas/WMC">returned
data from that request</a> includes a set of keys, the values
of which contains the GSS code in <tt>codes.gss</tt>.
</p>

<h3>Find Candidates for a Constituency</h3>

<p>
    You can request all the candidates in that constituency by
    querying posts with the <tt>extra_slug</tt> filter
    parameter.  For example, for Dulwich and West Norwood, which
    has the GSS code <tt>E14000673</tt>, you would make the request:
    <a href="{{ base_api_url }}posts/WMC:E14000673/">{{ base_api_url }}posts/WMC:E14000673/</a>
</p>

<p>
    Each of the <tt>memberships</tt> in that response links to a
    person who is a candidate in that constituency for any known
    election.  The <tt>election</tt> property of each membership
    tells you which election that candidacy is for.
</p>

<h4>Pre 2016 data</h4>

<p>
  Prior to the 2016 local and regional elections we used the MapIt codes
  for areas. For postcode lookups this is available from <tt>shortcuts.wmc</tt>
  in the returned object. For the point lookup and by type lookups the
  MapIt ID are contained in the keys of the returned object.
</p>

<p>
  Dulwich and West Norwood as a MapIt ID of 65808 so to look up the pre 2016
  results you would make the request:
  <a href="{{ base_api_url }}posts/65808/">{{ base_api_url }}posts/65808/</a>
</p>
