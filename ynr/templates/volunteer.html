<h2>Democracy needs you!</h2>

<p>We need your help collecting candidate information. Read this guide to understand how you can help!</p>

<p>Democracy Club Candidates is an open-source database of all candidates standing in UK elections.
Its data powers Democracy Club's <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/">Who Can I Vote For?</a>, and is regularly used by a wide range of organisations, including <a href="https://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/">The Electoral Commission</a>, social media
companies, and national newspapers.</p>

<h3>You can help crowdsource candidates</h3>

<p>Elections in the UK are run on a local level by individual councils. This means that the state does not collect a
central list of candidates in a given election. This site aims to fill that gap. Hundreds of brilliant contributors,
like you, come together to make this data available.</p>

<p>First you must <a href="{% url 'wombles:login' %}">create your account</a>. User accounts are
necessary for transparency and security of the database - all edits are logged and recorded on each candidate profile. 
Edits are reviewed by Democracy Club staff, and users will be banned if vandalism is suspected.</p>

<h3>Finding and editing candidates</h3>
<p>You can find an existing candidate profile using the search function at the top of this page. 
Candidate profiles can be edited to add text and links using the ‘edit candidate button’, or you can add a photo using the separate button. </p>

<p>Please check to see whether a profile already exists before creating a new candidate.</p>

<p>With the exception of Wikipedia, all links must by owned and run by the candidate or their party. 
Text for personal statements will ideally be taken from these same sources, although statements submitted to third parties (eg. newspapers) can be acceptable.</p>

<p>Edits to Democracy Club Candidates can take between a few minutes and a couple of hours to update on <a href="https://whocanivotefor.co.uk/">WhoCanIVoteFor</a>, depending on current site traffic. 
  You find a direct link to each candidate’s public-facing profile on their page.</p>

<h3>Adding candidates to an election</h3>

<p>You can add past candidates to future elections by editing the candidate and using the ‘New ballot’ fields on the candidate’s profile. 
Alternatively, you can add a new candidate by finding the ballot you want from <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/elections/">the elections list</a> and selecting ‘Add a new candidate’. </p>

<p>You can also add multiple candidates for the same party in one go. To do this, select the council from the ‘election’ column on <a href="https://candidates.democracyclub.org.uk/elections/">the elections list</a>, and then select ‘add candidates for a single party’ (on a desktop this button appears on the right-hand side, on small screens at the bottom of the page).</p>
  
<h3 >Editing candidate profiles</h3>

<p>Each candidate profile contains a list of fields which can be edited. Some points to bear in mind:</p>

<h4>Links</h4>

<p>When entering web addresses, please include the entire URL. For example:
<a href="https://democracyclub.org.uk/">https://democracyclub.org.uk/</a> not democracyclub.org.uk
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/democracyclub/">https://www.facebook.com/democracyclub/</a> not facebook.com/democracyclub (or @democracyclub)</p>

<h4 >Names</h4>

<p>Names should be written in the style: Firstname Lastname. Where possible try to enter the name exactly as it appears
on the nomination papers. Alternative names are automatically added when the main name field is changed.</p>

<h4>Statement to voters</h4>

<p>The statement to voters should be taken from a candidate's official webpage or leaflet, and be directly relevant
to the upcoming election.</p>

<h4>Favourite biscuit</h4>

<p>Please only edit this field if you are the candidate, or have a
<a href="https://www.mumsnet.com/politics/politicians-best-answers-mumsnet-biscuit-question">cast-iron source</a>.
As a strictly non-partisan organisation, Democracy Club does not have a position regarding the status of Jaffa Cakes.</p>

<h4>Candidate Photos</h4>

<p>Photos must be a clear, recent, colour headshot of the candidate. <a href="{% url 'help-photo-policy' %}">See our photo policy for more details.</a></p>

<p>All photo uploads will be moderated by a Democracy Club staff member or experienced contributor before they appear on the
profile. </p>

<h3>Citing sources</h3>

<p>Please provide a link to a primary source whenever editing a profile. Ideally, this will be a link to a candidate's
party webpage or specific social media post. Unsourced edits are liable to be removed.</p>

<h3>SOPNs and ballot locking</h3>

<p>Candidates are officially confirmed as standing only when the Statement of Persons Nominated (SOPN) is published on
the relevant council website (this varies depending on the nation and election type, but is between 16 and 23 working
days before the poll).</p>

<p>Democracy Club Candidates archives all SOPNs and makes them accessible from the relevant ballot page. Once a SoPN is
published, you can add it to a ballot by selecting ‘Upload SOPN' and adding the PDF file from your computer.</p>

<p>Once the SOPN is uploaded, please add any remaining candidates and remove those not nominated. Then select ‘suggest
locking'. This will add the ballot to a queue to be double checked by a member of the Democracy Club team or a experienced contributor.</p>

<p>Once this final process is complete, the ballot will be ‘locked' and no new candidates can be added.</p>

<h4>Automation</h4>

<p>Democracy Club Candidates automates certain tasks:</p>

<p>We have a script to assist with the transcription of SOPNs during major elections. In this case, the contributor
task is to review these automated transcriptions.</p>

<h3>Data publication and deletion</h3>

<p>The following fields are not displayed on WhoCanIVoteFor.co.uk: Title / pre-nominal honorific, post-nominal letters,
alternative names, and all demographic data.</p>

<p>All changes to profiles are saved in the changelog, which can be viewed at the bottom of each candidate profile
(logged in users only).</p>

<p>If you wish Democracy Club to remove any data we hold on your own profile (including in the changelog), please email
candidates@democracyclub.org.uk with the details. We retain name, party, and election information as these are
matters of public record.</p>

<h3>Reporting problems and bugs</h3>
